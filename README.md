# Awesome Python Web Frameworks


A curated list of awesome Python Web Frameworks (micro, full-stack, REST, etc.)

---

## Full-stack frameworks, including data layer (ORM)


- [Django](https://github.com/django/django) ★56368 - a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Includes ORM, templatting engine, etc.


## Full-stack frameworks, but data-layer agnostic

- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) ★54259 - a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
- [Pyramid](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid) ★3531 - a small, fast, down-to-earth, open source Python web framework. It makes real-world web application development and deployment more fun, more predictable, and more productive.


## Micro-frameworks

### Sync

- [Bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle) ★7214 - a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
- [Molten](https://github.com/Bogdanp/molten) ★963 - A minimal, extensible, fast and productive framework for building HTTP APIs with Python 3.6 and later.
- [Morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) ★387 - "web microframework with super powers". An application consists of models. Each type of model is published on a URL path. Content is exposed to the web using views.


### Async

- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) ★28766 - a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- [Sanic](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic) ★14703 - a Python 3.7+ web server and web framework that's written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy. Based on Starlette.
- [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) ★5312 - a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services.
- [BlackSheep](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep) ★454 - BlackSheep is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web applications with Python.
