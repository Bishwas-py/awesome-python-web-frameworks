## Micro-frameworks

### Sync

- [Bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle) ★7214 - a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
- [Molten](https://github.com/Bogdanp/molten) ★963 - A minimal, extensible, fast and productive framework for building HTTP APIs with Python 3.6 and later.
- [Morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) ★387 - "web microframework with super powers". An application consists of models. Each type of model is published on a URL path. Content is exposed to the web using views.


### Async

- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) ★28768 - a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
  - [Awesome FastAPI](https://github.com/mjhea0/awesome-fastapi)
- [Sanic](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic) ★14703 - a Python 3.7+ web server and web framework that's written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy. Based on Starlette.
  - [Awesome Sanic](https://github.com/mekicha/awesome-sanic)
- [Aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) ★10979 - Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python

## Additional resources

- Awesome Python has some web frameworks, in two sections: [Web Frameworks](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#web-frameworks) and [RESTful API](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#restful-api) but it's not very thorough.
