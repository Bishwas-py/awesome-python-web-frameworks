## Micro-frameworks

### Sync

- [Falcon](https://github.com/falconry/falcon) ★8509 - a reliable, high-performance Python web framework for building large-scale app backends and microservices. It encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while remaining highly effective.
- [Bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle) ★7323 - a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
- [Hug](https://github.com/hugapi/hug) ★6529 - aims to make developing Python driven APIs as simple as possible, but no simpler. As a result, it drastically simplifies Python API development.
- [Molten](https://github.com/Bogdanp/molten) ★957 - A minimal, extensible, fast and productive framework for building HTTP APIs with Python 3.6 and later.
- [Morepath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) ★389 - "web microframework with super powers". An application consists of models. Each type of model is published on a URL path. Content is exposed to the web using views.


### Async

- [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) ★34562 - a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
  - [Awesome FastAPI](https://github.com/mjhea0/awesome-fastapi)
- [Sanic](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic) ★15204 - a Python 3.7+ web server and web framework that's written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy. Based on Starlette.
  - [Awesome Sanic](https://github.com/mekicha/awesome-sanic)
- [Aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) ★11500 - Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python
- [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) ★5889 - a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services.
- [BlackSheep](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep) ★631 - BlackSheep is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web applications with Python.


### REST frameworks

- [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) ★21583 - a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
- [Eve](https://github.com/pyeve/eve) ★6369 - an open source Python REST API framework based on Flask. It allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured RESTful Web Services. Eve offers native support for MongoDB, and SQL backends via community extensions.
- [Flask-Restful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful) ★6126 - Simple framework for creating REST APIs.
- [API star](https://github.com/encode/apistar) ★5578 - a framework-agnostic toolkit for working with OpenAPI or Swagger schemas.
- [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) ★3745 - Swagger/OpenAPI First framework for Python on top of Flask with automatic endpoint validation & OAuth2 support.

## Additional resources

- Awesome Python has some web frameworks, in two sections: [Web Frameworks](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#web-frameworks) and [RESTful API](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#restful-api) but it's not very thorough.
